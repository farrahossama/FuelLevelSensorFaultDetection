# Simulink Automotive Fuel Level Sensor Fault Detection
This model filters fuel sensor readings to reduce noise using a median filter. It then calculates how fast the fuel level is changing, considering the car's mode and speed, to spot unusual changes. If a problem is found, it checks with a diagnostic system to confirm. It also raises a signal if the fuel level is below 5 liters. This model is compatiable with code generation
